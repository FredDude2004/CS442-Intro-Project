Report on Collaborating with AI to Design a Simple HTML Website

In this project, we collaborated with an artificial intelligence system to design a simple HTML website. The process was a combination of my input in guiding the design goals and the AI’s assistance in producing the technical foundation. This report itself is also AI-generated, demonstrating the extended role that artificial intelligence played throughout the project.
My contribution focused on providing the vision and requirements for the website. We determined the purpose, content, and desired structure of the site. For example, we specified that the page should include a header, navigation menu, body text, and footer. We also clarified stylistic preferences such as simplicity, readability, and clean layout. By articulating these goals, we ensured that the website would reflect my intentions while still leaving the technical execution to the AI.
The AI’s main role was to create the boilerplate code. It automatically generated the essential HTML structure, including the <!DOCTYPE html> declaration, <head> metadata, and <body> section. In addition, it suggested best practices such as linking a stylesheet and using semantic tags like <header>, <main>, and <footer>. This saved us considerable time, since we did not have to recall every syntax rule or template by memory. From there, we were able to edit and customize the content more easily.
This collaboration highlights the efficiency of working with AI in web design. Rather than starting from a blank page, we began with a functional, standards-compliant template. The AI acted as a knowledgeable assistant, providing a strong technical base while leaving space for my creative direction. The result was a streamlined workflow that produced a simple yet effective website.
In conclusion, the project demonstrated how AI can serve as both a technical collaborator and a writing partner. Not only did the AI generate the boilerplate code for the website, but it also generated this report to document the process. This dual role shows the growing potential of AI in supporting both creative and technical aspects of digital projects.
