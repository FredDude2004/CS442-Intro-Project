Report on Collaborating with AI to Design a Simple HTML Website

Team Fried Eggs: Kaleb Duchesneau, Abdelrahman Ahmed, Dermot Hickey, Jay Patel

In this project, we used a couple of different LLM's to streamline the design process.
The page was made with vanilla HTML, CSS and JavaScript. Which is something that has been
done thousands of time before, which makes the models excel at this aspect. So There really
is no point in doing it yourself. We could have, but that would have taken an astronomical
amount of time that could have been allocated to studying for other class, social activites,
smelling the roses and overall enjoying life. And in the end we would have the same result if
not worse, or maybe slightly better.

Anthropic's Claude Code generated a single index.html file with a style and script tag, making
a sleek modern Single Page Application (SPA). To make this easier for the team to understand
and modify we went ahead and broke the code into multiple files, seperating concerns and
making it easier to extend and change. One thing that the AI did poorly was the use of 
"Magic Numbers" for the colors in the style page. The model just hardcoded all of
the values for the background and font colors, so we went and manually made global variables
and substituded all the values with the variables, once again making it easier to maintain.
Also the color theme that the model chose was quite horrendous.

Using AI in this case was just a good idea, it is something that is simple and has been done
thousands of times before. We beleive that AI is an excellent tool especially in cases where
things don't really have an impact. Like the color of the page and the design is something
that you can spend a lifetime learning about and mastering, or you can just have AI generate
a modern design that is sleek and follows all of the best practices, without sinking days
of your life trying to get a box to be the right size.
