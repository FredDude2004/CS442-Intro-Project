        <h3>Projects</h3>
        <p class="description">The last project I worked on was an AI model to predict heart cancer. The model was designed using Python and the sickit learn library.<br>
          I had a 500 x 14 data set to train and test the model according to standard practices. Using linear regresion the model was able to detect no heart cancer, and stages 1 through 4 <br>
          with approximatley 90% accuracy
