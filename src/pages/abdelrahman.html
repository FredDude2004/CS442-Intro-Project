        <h3>Education</h3>
        <p class="description">
          I am working toward a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science at PNW 
          and plan to graduate in May 2026. With a GPA of 3.5, 
          I have consistently earned placement on the Deanâ€™s List and Honors recognition, 
          reflecting both dedication and strong academic performance. 
          My coursework spans essential areas of the discipline, 
          including Data Structures and Algorithms, Computer Architecture, Operating Systems, 
          Networking, Artificial Intelligence, and systems-level programming in C. 
          This combination of studies has given me both a broad technical foundation 
          and the ability to approach complex problems with precision.        </p>

        <h3>Projects</h3>
        <p class="description">
          My project experience reflects both my current work and the skills 
          I am actively developing. I have built a Tic-Tac-Toe game and 
          am continuing to refine it, focusing on improving functionality and 
          user experience. I also plan to expand my portfolio by creating a 
          Snake game along with other small, interactive applications that 
          strengthen my programming abilities while keeping development fun and engaging. 
          These projects allow me to apply computer science concepts in practice and 
          steadily grow my proficiency in software development.

        <h3>Skills</h3>
        <p class="description">
          I have applied a variety of programming languages across my projects, 
          including Java, C, and Python. In addition, 
          I am proficient with tools such as Windows, Linux, VS Code, 
          and Git/GitHub, which have strengthened my ability to work confidently
          in both development and deployment environments.
