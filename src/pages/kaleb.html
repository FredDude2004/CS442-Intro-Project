        <h3>Education</h3>
        <p>
          Iâ€™m a computer science student with a true interest in fundamentals.
          I'm in the very early stages of my career and want to build a strong
          foundation. I've been focusing really hard on understanding the basics
          of Computer Science, and I've been doing that by reading as much as I
          can about Computer Architecture, Operating Systems and Networking. My
          technical background includes Object-Oriented Programming, data
          structures and algorithms, and databases using PostgreSQL. I want to
          get into software engineering because this is truly what fits my
          personality, and the things that I have been interested in ever since
          childhood. The idea of being able to make a career out of this brings
          me joy :)
