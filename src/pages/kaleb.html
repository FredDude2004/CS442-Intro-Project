        <h3>Education</h3>
        <p class="description">
          I am pursuing a B.S. in Computer Science at PNW with expecting to
          graduate in May 2027. I currently hold a 3.93 GPA, have consistently
          earned Deanâ€™s List and Honors recognition, and am deeply engaged with
          my coursework. My studies have provided me with a strong foundation
          across core areas of computer science, including Data Structures &
          Algorithms, Computer Architecture, Operating Systems, Computer
          Networking, Artificial Intelligence, and Systems Programming in C.
          This academic preparation is shaping both my problem-solving ability
          and my technical depth in areas highly relevant to modern software
          development and security.

        <h3>Skills</h3>
        <p class="description">
          My project experience emphasizes full-stack development, systems
          programming, and practical applications of computer science concepts.
          As team lead on myrepertoire.io, I built and continue to maintain a
          full-stack web application that helps users quiz themselves on chess
          openings. The platform uses Next.js, Go, and PostgreSQL, with a custom
          lexical analyzer and parser for PGN data, a RESTful API with
          JWT-secured authentication, and Docker-based deployment on a VPS.
          Beyond that, I developed a collaborative Jukebox Application with
          Flask, SQLite, and Bootstrap, integrating yt-dlp and FFmpeg for
          YouTube streaming and designing a multithreaded queue system that
          allowed groups of users to share and control music playback in real
          time. Additionally, I wrote an Interpreter for a Programming Language
          in Go, implementing a lexer, Pratt parser, REPL, environment model,
          and garbage-collected object systemâ€”extending it with arrays, hashes,
          and functions to create a flexible scripting language.

        <h3>Projects</h3>
        <p class="description">
          I have used a range of programming languages for my projects,
          including Java, C, C++, Go, Python, TypeScript, HTML/CSS, SQL,
          Node.js, and React.js, supported by experience with MATLAB in academic
          settings. My toolset includes Linux, Neovim, Git/GitHub, Docker, AWS,
          and Bootstrap, reflecting comfort with both development environments
          and deployment workflows. This blend of low-level systems knowledge,
          web frameworks, and cloud/container technologies enables me to move
          seamlessly between backend systems, frontend development, and
          DevOps-style deployment. Together, these skills equip me to take on
          software engineering challenges that require both technical depth and
          the ability to deliver polished, user-facing solutions.
